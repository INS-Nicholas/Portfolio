This is my online portfolio! Everything posted is owned personal content.

SF NICHOLAS
SF stands for Sunless Fiend, which is actually an anagram for 'Fun is endless'.
Hi all, I'm a caffiene addict with a terrible sense of time and direction but have huge goals! 
Hard worker, as you can see. This portfolio is going to eventually have an embedded HTML5 game on the main page, 
that will allow users to explore my works for themselves.
Nifty, right?
